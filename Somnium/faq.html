			<dt>What is Somnium?</dt>
			<dd>Somnium is a web service that allows users to leverage Neural Style Transfer to create beautiful pieces of artwork.</dd>
			<dt>What is Neural Style Transfer?</dt>
			<dd>Neural Style Transfer is an optimization technique used to take three images, a content image, a style reference image (such as an artwork by a famous painter), and the input image you want to style and blend them together such that the input image is transformed to look like the content image, but "painted" in the style of the style image.</dd>
			<dt>Is it free to use?</dt>
			<dd>At the moment, Somnium is completely free to use with no limitations. In the future, a premium option may be added to allow larger resolution outputs and additional styles.</dd>
			<dt>Is it the same as DeepDream?</dt>
			<dd>Somnium is based on DeepDream. DeepDream uses a deep convolutional neural network to "hallucinate" patterns in images by emphasizing features that it detects. On the other hand, Somnium "repaints" an image based on the style of another image.</dd>
