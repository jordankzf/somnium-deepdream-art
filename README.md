# Somnium DeepDream Art

Context: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepDream

Using HTML & CSS, I created this dynamic mockup website to showcase art generated by Google's DeepDream program. DeepDream was what piqued my interest in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, its psychedelic aeshetic that is 'hallucinated' by computers is fascinating beyond words.

No output image is produced. | Upload section is non-functional on purpose, as it was created only to demonstrate the visual design of the website without the need for it to be actually working. |
